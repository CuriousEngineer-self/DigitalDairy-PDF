# DigitalDairy-PDF
Python program to generate PDF digital diary.
This is a personal project for me to learn python programmming, which i did using opepyxl initially and later abandoned that code in favor of reportlab based PDF generation. In this case, i wanted to test if the latest, free,versions of the AI tools can generate the code from my English description of the code - i gave 12 requirements. ChatGPT did try to come out with the code but it couldnt fully comprehend my requirements. I found Claude to be very comprehensive in terms of not only understanding my requirements but also gave a highly defensive approach- for example, if you want a certain background for the diary it would check for the backgroung image in a specific place and if not, it will generate some image and use this, instead of the code throwing out some incomprehensible errors. The code is almost 100% generated by AI.
Currently, although i have integrated a password based ecurity for the diary, it doesnt yet have the personal information to be put in the diary- need a little time to make this work.
Added PIM on 3/9/3=2025. But not yet tested in addition, need to fix fonts, background and also page 3. Will do them in a while.

Here is how you can use it to generate a personal diary -

Install reportlab library using pip or your favorite package manager and if you want install Dancing Script fone to enhance the beauty.

The background images for the 4 seasons should be stored in the images subfolder as: summer_bg.jpg, winter_bg.jpg,autumn_bg.jpg, spring_jpg.

Then run: python enhanced_diary.py  2025 # for the 2025 diary or anyother year so that 1900 < yaer < 2100.

If all goes well, you will be prompted for a password to encrypt the PDF and if you successfully give the password, diary_2025.pdf will be created in the current folder.
